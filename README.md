   - Enter the search word/phrase.
   - Click **Search** ‚Äî script searches all text layers and lists matches.

## ‚úÖ Notes & Limitations
- The preview "highlight" inside the dialog is a **simulated, temporary preview** (non-destructive). The script does **not** permanently change text color unless you press **Change**.
- Complex text layer behaviors (rich text with varied character styles) may impose edge-cases. The script uses string-based replacement using index/length which works reliably for common text layers.
- Paragraph vs. Point text: script operates on `textItem.contents`. Extremely complex text compositions (linked text frames or special native text selections) can behave differently.
- Always keep a saved copy of your PSD before running bulk automated edits (best practice for any automation).

---

## üîß Troubleshooting
- **No matches found** ‚Äî ensure your search term is correct (case-insensitive search is performed). If you used regex-special characters, escape them or use plain text.
- **Selected layer is not a text layer** ‚Äî switch to a text layer or use a document with text layers.
- **Script doesn‚Äôt appear in File ‚Üí Scripts** ‚Äî confirm you placed the `.jsx` in the Presets/Scripts folder and restarted Photoshop.
